Project Description: Predicting Abalone Age Using Linear Regression

Background:
Abalone is a type of marine mollusk with a shell that is quite intriguing, both in terms of beauty and commercial value. One important factor in determining the commercial value of abalone is its age. The age of an abalone can be determined by counting the number of rings on its shell.

Project Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model using linear regression that can predict the age of abalone based on several physical features.
